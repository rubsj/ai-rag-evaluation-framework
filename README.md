# P2: RAG Evaluation Benchmarking Framework

I tested 16 RAG configurations and found that semantic chunking + OpenAI embeddings + Cohere reranking gets 0.747 Recall@5 on structured Markdown docs. This is how I got there.

Part of a 9-project portfolio built in 8 weeks. 5 ADRs, 557 tests, 12 evaluation charts.

## Results

Best config: **E-openai** (semantic chunking by Markdown headers + OpenAI text-embedding-3-small).

| Metric | Before Reranking | After Reranking | Improvement |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Recall@5** | 0.625 | 0.747 | +19.5% |
| **Precision@5** | 0.346 | 0.457 | +32.1% |
| **MRR@5** | 0.533 | 0.638 | +19.7% |

Semantic chunking splits at header boundaries, so each chunk maps to a coherent section instead of cutting mid-paragraph. That alone beat every fixed-size config by 3-22% on Recall@5.

## Findings

Evaluated on 3 Kaggle Markdown documents (technical reports, ~15K tokens total).

| Experiment | Result | Data |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Chunk Size | 256 tokens best. 128 too granular, 512 too coarse. | 256t: 0.607 R@5 vs 512t: 0.512 R@5 |
| Overlap | 50% overlap hurt ranking. 25% was better. | 25%: 0.607 R@5 vs 50%: 0.529 R@5 |
| Embeddings | OpenAI beat both local models by 26%. | OpenAI 1536d: 0.607 vs MiniLM 384d: 0.481 |
| Semantic vs Fixed | Structure-aware chunking beat all fixed-size configs. | Config E: 0.625 R@5 vs Config B: 0.607 R@5 |
| BM25 Baseline | Vector search beat lexical by 64%. | BM25: 0.381 vs E-openai: 0.625 |
| Reranking | Cohere cross-encoder gave ~20% lift at $0.05/168 reranks. | E-openai: 0.625 → 0.747 R@5 |
| RAGAS | Retrieval solid (73% context precision), generation weak (51% faithfulness). | Faithfulness: 0.511, Context Precision: 0.734 |
| Judge Calibration | 73% hallucination rate was inflated. 22/41 were refusals, not hallucinations. | 22/41 flagged = "I don't have enough context" |

### What the numbers mean

**Overlap is overrated.** Redundant chunks dilute the top-k instead of helping it. 10-25% overlap is enough to prevent boundary fragmentation. More than that and you're just giving the ranker more noise to sort through.

**Embedding training data matters more than dimensionality.** MPnet (768d) performed no better than MiniLM (384d). OpenAI (1536d) beat both by 26%. If the gap were about dimensions, MPnet should sit between the two. It doesn't. I think this is OpenAI's supervised training data doing the work.

**Reranking is the cheapest win.** ~20% average lift for $0.05/168 reranks. Config D (50% overlap) got the largest lift, which makes sense: reranking cleans up the redundancy that high overlap introduces. For production, I'd always run 2-stage retrieval: fast vector search top-20, then cross-encoder rerank to top-5.

**Always manually sample your LLM judge.** The judge flagged 73% hallucination, but when I looked at the actual responses, 22 of 41 were the model refusing to answer ("I don't have enough context"). That's a prompt calibration issue, not a hallucination problem.

**Production should use hybrid retrieval.** BM25 + vector search via Reciprocal Rank Fusion beats either method alone. This framework finds the best single-method config. Real systems should combine them.

**The production config this data points to:** semantic chunking at section boundaries, OpenAI text-embedding-3-small, 2-stage retrieval with Cohere reranking (vector search top-20, rerank to top-5), and BM25+vector hybrid via RRF. Generation needs prompt tuning to push faithfulness above 51%.

```

The 16 configs come from crossing 5 chunking strategies with 3 embedding models, plus a BM25 baseline on one config. Chunking strategies: Config A (128/32), Config B (256/64), Config C (512/128), Config D (256/128 for 50% overlap), Config E (semantic split on Markdown headers). Embedding models: MiniLM 384d, MPnet 768d, OpenAI text-embedding-3-small 1536d. Each config gets its own FAISS index. All 16 are evaluated against the same 56 synthetic QA pairs so comparisons are apples-to-apples.

### Design decisions

| ADR | Decision | Why |
|-----|----------|-----|
| [ADR-001](docs/adr/ADR-001-faiss-over-chromadb-lancedb.md) | FAISS over ChromaDB/LanceDB | Brute-force exact search for <1K vectors. Benchmarking needs deterministic results, not approximate nearest neighbor. |
| [ADR-002](docs/adr/ADR-002-chunk-size-overlap-semantic.md) | 5-config experimental design | Isolate chunk size, overlap, and semantic variables independently so each experiment changes one thing. |
| [ADR-003](docs/adr/ADR-003-embedding-model-comparison.md) | Local + API embedding models | ThreadPoolExecutor for API calls; sequential for local models to stay within RAM. |
| [ADR-004](docs/adr/ADR-004-synthetic-qa-generation-strategies.md) | 5 QA generation strategies | Multiple question types so evaluation isn't biased toward one retrieval pattern. |
| [ADR-005](docs/adr/ADR-005-semantic-vs-fixed-chunking-results.md) | Semantic vs fixed-size comparison | Semantic chunking looked better in early runs but the margin was small. Needed controlled comparison to confirm it wasn't noise. |

### Evaluation charts

The embedding model rows cluster tightly regardless of chunk config. The vertical bands show that chunk size barely moves the needle compared to embedding model choice.

Every config improved with reranking. The weakest configs got the biggest lift, which suggests reranking partially compensates for bad chunking or weak embeddings.

MPnet (768d) and MiniLM (384d) are nearly identical. The jump happens at OpenAI (1536d). If dimensionality were the driver, MPnet should sit in between.

## Tech Stack

| Component | Library | Why this one |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Vector search | FAISS IndexFlatIP | Exact brute-force. Under 1K vectors, approximate methods add complexity for no speed gain. |
| Lexical search | rank-bm25 | BM25Okapi for the baseline comparison. Lightweight, no index server needed. |
| Reranking | Cohere Rerank API | Cross-encoder reranking. Free tier handles the full eval without hitting limits. |
| Embeddings (local) | sentence-transformers (MiniLM, MPnet) | Standard library for local embedding inference. Two models at different dimensionalities to test the size-vs-quality question. |
| Embeddings (API) | LiteLLM (OpenAI text-embedding-3-small) | Provider-agnostic wrapper. Could swap in Cohere or Voyage embeddings without changing pipeline code. |
| Chunking | langchain-text-splitters + custom Markdown header splitter | langchain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter for fixed-size configs A-D. Custom splitter for semantic config E because langchain's MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter didn't handle nested headers the way I needed. |
| Evaluation | RAGAS, judges library | RAGAS for generation quality (faithfulness, context precision). judges for LLM-as-Judge with Bloom's taxonomy classifier. |
| Experiment tracking | Braintrust | Logs every config with inputs, outputs, scores, and feedback classification. Makes it easy to compare runs across iterations. |
| Generation | OpenAI GPT-4o-mini + Instructor | GPT-4o-mini for QA generation and RAG answers. Instructor for structured output parsing so I get validated Pydantic objects instead of raw JSON. |
| Visualization | Matplotlib/Seaborn + Plotly | Static PNGs (Matplotlib/Seaborn) for the README and Git-tracked charts. Plotly only in the Streamlit dashboard where interactivity adds value. |
| Demo | Streamlit (7-page dashboard), Click CLI + Rich | Streamlit for visual exploration. CLI for scripted reporting and quick comparisons from the terminal. |

## Quick Start

```bash
cd ai-rag-evaluation-framework
uv sync
cp .env.example .env  # Add OPENAI_API_KEY, COHERE_API_KEY, BRAINTRUST_API_KEY

# Run full evaluation pipeline (~15 min first run)
# Subsequent runs use the MD5-keyed JSON cache in data/cache/ (369 files)
# and complete in ~2 min. Delete data/cache/ to force fresh API calls.
python -m src.grid_search

# Run tests (557 tests: schema validation, chunker correctness, metric computation)
pytest

# Generate all 12 visualizations
python -c "from src.visualization import generate_all_charts; generate_all_charts()"

# CLI reporting
python -m src.cli report              # Rich-formatted results table
python -m src.cli compare E-openai B-openai  # Side-by-side comparison

# Launch Streamlit demo
uv run streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Required API keys: `OPENAI_API_KEY` (embeddings + generation), `COHERE_API_KEY` (reranking, free tier works), `BRAINTRUST_API_KEY` (experiment tracking).

## Known Gaps

- **Only tested on structured Markdown.** Semantic chunking won because the input documents have clear header hierarchies. On unstructured text (PDFs, transcripts, scraped HTML), fixed-size chunking might perform equally well or better. I scoped to structured docs first to isolate the semantic vs fixed-size question cleanly.
- **56 QA pairs is a small eval set.** I scoped to 56 to keep full pipeline iteration under 15 minutes. Enough to show directional differences between configs, but confidence intervals are wide. Production eval would need 200+ questions with human-verified ground truth.
- **51% faithfulness is low.** Retrieval is working. Generation isn't. I focused this project on the retrieval side deliberately. Prompt tuning and few-shot examples for generation quality is the next layer.
- **Single-method retrieval only.** I compared vector search and BM25 separately but didn't implement hybrid retrieval (Reciprocal Rank Fusion). The data shows RRF would be the right production choice. This framework isolates single-method performance to make that comparison possible.
- **No latency benchmarking.** I measured quality but not speed. For production, the embedding and reranking latency tradeoffs matter. Quality-first was the right order for this evaluation.
